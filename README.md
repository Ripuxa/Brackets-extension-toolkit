#Brackets Extension toolkit

This extension was created to make building Brackets extensions easier.

The toolkit:
1. Contains a customizable extension template you can just drag and drop to create new extension very quickly.
2. Adds useful shortcuts to the `Help` menu to directly open the Brackets `src` folder, and to open the Brackets wiki in a new browser window.
3. Uses its own source code to help new developers understand how to build extensions.

##Instructions

Install as any Bracket extension (see below), and check the `Help` menu.

To use the template, simply browse for this extension "template" folder and copy it under the user folder.
Alternatively, you can copy it in the `extensions/disabled` folder.

To learn how to build extensions, choose `Open Extension Tutorial src` under the `Help` menu: it will open its own source code.


##Installing Brackets extensions

1. Download this extension using the ZIP button above and unzip it.
2. Copy it in Brackets' `/extensions/user` folder by selecting `Help > Show Extension Folder` in the app menu. 
3. Relaunch or Reload Brackets (`Ctrl/Cmd+R`).
